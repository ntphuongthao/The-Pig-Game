# The-Pig-Game

A player wins when strategically achieving a score of at least 100. In the case of a non-one roll of the dice, the current player can either add the point to the cumulative sum at that point and stop or continue rolling. Upon rolling the dice, a player will lose their entire score if the number one is thrown.
